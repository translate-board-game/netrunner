    Awakening Center can host <strong>bioroid</strong> ice (each piece is
    installed facedown, ignoring all install costs).

    Whenever the Runner passes all of the ice protecting this server, you
    may rez a piece of ice on Awakening Center, lowering the rez cost by
    7[Credits], to force the Runner to encounter it. Trash that ice after
    the run is completed.
