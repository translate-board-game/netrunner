    "CyberSolutions is a boring name for a company that makes pretty exciting
    products. Their memory chips have some pretty tricky stuff going on
    inside and I keep hearing good things about their M/MI implants. I even
    heard they were on the path to their own androids about a year ago.
    I wonder whatever happened with that?" -Kate "Mac" McCaffrey
