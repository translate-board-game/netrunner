    The Akamatsu company was founded on three principles: first, to make
    the fastest mem chips on the market, second, to turn a profit, and third,
    to serve as a front for the manufacture of illegal neural-stimulants.
    It is the last principle that perhaps explains their rabid brand loyalty.
