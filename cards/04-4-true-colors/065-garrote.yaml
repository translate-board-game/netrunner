    The first credited icebreaker was nothing more than a unique script
    to bypass the security calls on a Gibson 3 Data Sentry. Garrote has
    over 20,000 times the data as that first breaker, but the idea remains
    the same: cut off the power source from the network, and then smash
    on through.
