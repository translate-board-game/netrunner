    This ice disguises itself as a series of electronic transactions, tying
    up the runner's funds in a thousand or so non-existent purchases and
    refunds. The banks' system of holds and checks means that while not
    a single credit ever leaves their servers the runner has no available
    funds. RSVP also has the unfortunate side effect of being entirely legal...strictly
    speaking.
